## Requirements

__We highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) as your default Python distribution in order to avoid
unnecessary messes.__

+ OpenCV3: `conda install -c menpo opencv3=3.1.0` (for image and video processing)
+ FFMPEG: `conda install -c soft-matter ffmpeg=2.2.4` (for supporting video analysis)
+ PyAV: `conda install -c soft-matter pyav=v0.2.3.post0` (for reading videos)
+ PyQtGraph: `conda install pyqtgraph` (for GUI viewer)

Note that above requirements are installed with `conda` - the package management system
provided along with `Anaconda`. Make sure you installed them before installing the package

## Installation

__Assumed you've installed above requirements__

Get the bleeding edge by:

```
pip install git+git://github.com/duguyue100/retina-simulation.git
```

## Start Retina Simulation Viewer

__Caution: This feature may not work with Windows platform where the
path feature is not defined in `/usr/bin/env` as *nix platforms.__

After you successfully installed the package, you are able to start the
retina viewer from terminal:

```
retina_viewer.py
```

Note that above file is automatically added in your system path once
you installed the package.
