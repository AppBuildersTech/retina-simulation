This project is our final project to _Computer Simulation for Sensory Systems_.

Detailed software setup can be found from [WIKI](https://github.com/duguyue100/retina-simulation/wiki/Software-Setup)

## Todos

- [x] Update dataset module [WIKI](https://github.com/duguyue100/retina-simulation/wiki/simretina-Python-API) [2016-05-09]
- [x] update basic processing functions on GUI and retina model [2016-05-17]
- [x] First release of GUI by `PyQtGraph`
- [x] Webcam support for the package
- [ ] External file support
- [ ] `unittest`-based tests
- [ ] Travis-CI integration

## Requirements

__We highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) as your default Python distribution in order to avoid
unnecessary messes.__

+ OpenCV3: `conda install -c menpo opencv3=3.1.0` (for image and video processing)
+ FFMPEG: `conda install -c soft-matter ffmpeg=2.2.4` (for supporting video analysis)
+ PyAV: `conda install -c soft-matter pyav=v0.2.3.post0` (for reading videos)
+ PyQtGraph: `conda install pyqtgraph` (for GUI viewer)

Note that above requirements are installed with `conda` - the package management system
provided along with `Anaconda`. Make sure you installed them before installing the package

## Installation

__Assumed you've installed above requirements__

Get the bleeding edge by:

```
pip install git+git://github.com/duguyue100/retina-simulation.git
```
